For example, if the child has\n`visibleWidths` set to `['small','medium']` then it will only\nbe visible in small and medium screen widths.\n\nHere is a simple example, where the first child is shown when the\nmedia size is `medium` or above, and the second child is shown only\nwhen the media size is below `medium`.\n\nThis components gets updates on the current responsive width\nof the screen. We can set the `visibleWidths` prop\nto the component and give it an\narray of responsive sizes where the component should be seen.\nFor example `visibleWidths={['small','medium']}` says that this\ncomponent should only be visible in small and medium sizes.\n\nIn the render method we can use `this.showAtVisibleWidth()`\nwhich will return `true` if the component should be visible at\nthe current size. Or your can use `this.mediaSelectorStyles()` to\nget a styles object that you can apply to the style property on\nyour top tag.\n\nIf you define `onMediaChange` you will get an update any time\nthe screen size changes.\n\n```jsx\n<JSMediaSelector>\n  <div visibleAtOrAbove=\"medium\">Shown in medium</div>\n  <div visibleBelow=\"medium\">Shown below medium</div>\n</JSMediaSelector>\n```\n@component JSMediaSelector\n@synonym responsive\n@import {JSMediaSelector}\n@playground\nJSMediaSelector\n```\n<JSMediaSelector mode=\"hide\">\n  <div visibleWidths={['small']}>Currently in small</div>\n  <div visibleWidths={['medium']}>Currently in medium</div>\n  <div visibleWidths={['large']}>Currently in large</div>\n  <div visibleWidths={['x-large']}>Currently in x-large</div>\n  <div visibleWidths={['xx-large']}>Currently in xx-large</div>\n  <hr/>\n\n  <div visibleAbove='small'>visibleAbove: Visible in Medium and above</div>\n  <div visibleAbove='medium'>visibleAbove: Visible in Large and above</div>\n  <hr/>\n\n  <div visibleAtOrAbove='medium'>visibleAtOrAbove: Visible in Medium and above</div>\n  <div visibleAtOrAbove='large'>visibleAtOrAbove: Visible in Large and above</div>\n  <hr/>\n\n  <div visibleBelow='medium'>visibleBelow: Visible in Small</div>\n  <div visibleBelow='large'>visibleBelow: Visible in Small and Medium</div>\n  <hr/>\n\n  <div visibleAtOrBelow='small'>visibleAtOrBelow: Visible in Small</div>\n  <div visibleAtOrBelow='medium'>visibleAtOrBelow: Visible in Small and Medium</div>\n  <hr/>\n\n  <div hiddenAbove='small'>hiddenAbove: Visible in Small</div>\n  <div hiddenAbove='medium'>hiddenAbove: Visible in Small and Medium</div>\n  <hr/>\n\n  <div hiddenAtOrAbove='medium'>hiddenAtOrAbove: Visible in Small</div>\n  <div hiddenAtOrAbove='large'>hiddenAtOrAbove: Visible in Small and Medium</div>\n  <hr/>\n\n  <div hiddenBelow='medium'>hiddenBelow: Visible above Small</div>\n  <div hiddenBelow='large'>hiddenBelow: Visible above Medium</div>\n  <hr/>\n\n  <div hiddenAtOrBelow='medium'>hiddenAtOrAbove: Visible in Large</div>\n  <div hiddenAtOrBelow='large'>hiddenAtOrAbove: Visible above Large</div>\n</JSMediaSelector>\n```\n*/\n\nvar JSMediaSelector = function (_Component) {\n  (0, _inherits3.default)(JSMediaSelector, _Component);\n\n  function JSMediaSelector(props, context) {\n    (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, JSMediaSelector);\n\n    var _this = (0, _possibleConstructorReturn3.default)(this, _Component.call(this, props, context));\n\n    if (_widthWatcher === null) {\n      _widthWatcher = new _widthWatcher2.WidthWatcher();\n    }\n\n    var width = _exenv.canUseDOM ?

Subsequent calls\n * to the debounced function return the result of the last `func` invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is invoked\n * on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function is\n * invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?
