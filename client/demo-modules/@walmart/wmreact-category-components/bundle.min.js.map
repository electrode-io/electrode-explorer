The base\n\theight is dynamically calculated, after the component has mounted, using the\n\theight of the tiles, the overall height of the container, and the number of rows\n\tthat should be displayed.\n\t\n\tThis component is responsive. The height of container will be recalculated on a\n\tscreen resize. To minimize the effects of many screen resizings, this method is\n\twrapped in lodash's debounce function.\n\t\n\t@examples\n\t```jsx\n\t<ModuleDrawer data={[\n\t  {\n\t    \"title\": \"TVs\",\n\t    \"url\": \"/browse/electronics/tvs/3944_1060825_447913\",\n\t    \"alt\": \"TVs\",\n\t    \"imageUrl\": \"//i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-5220/\" +\n\t      \"k2-_ace57524-f8e5-4fb9-8189-4f94adf6d011.v1.jpg\",\n\t    \"categoryId\": \"3944_1060825_447913\",\n\t    \"assetId\": \"b5f4c3d0-d357-11e4-8430-9bb6eb04884d\",\n\t    \"uid\": \"2TXEZx_h\"\n\t  },\n\t  {\n\t    \"title\": \"Laptops\",\n\t    \"url\": \"/browse/electronics/laptop-computers/3944_3951_132960\",\n\t    \"alt\": \"Laptops\",\n\t    \"imageUrl\": \"http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-ce9a/\" +\n\t      \"k2-_71a2c162-b553-428e-8e52-d149efbf0da9.v1.jpg\",\n\t    \"categoryId\": \"3944_3951_132960\",\n\t    \"assetId\": \"d1229ec0-d357-11e4-8c7c-258c79afbf66\",\n\t    \"uid\": \"IE78xV1I\"\n\t  }\n\t]} />\n\t```\n\t@component ModuleDrawer\n\t@import {ModuleDrawer}\n\t@playground\n\tModuleDrawer\n\t```\n\t<ModuleDrawer data={[\n\t  {\n\t    \"title\": \"TVs\",\n\t    \"url\": \"/browse/electronics/tvs/3944_1060825_447913\",\n\t    \"alt\": \"TVs\",\n\t    \"imageUrl\": \"//i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-5220/\" +\n\t      \"k2-_ace57524-f8e5-4fb9-8189-4f94adf6d011.v1.jpg\",\n\t    \"categoryId\": \"3944_1060825_447913\",\n\t    \"assetId\": \"b5f4c3d0-d357-11e4-8430-9bb6eb04884d\",\n\t    \"uid\": \"2TXEZx_h\"\n\t  },\n\t  {\n\t    \"title\": \"Laptops\",\n\t    \"url\": \"/browse/electronics/laptop-computers/3944_3951_132960\",\n\t    \"alt\": \"Laptops\",\n\t    \"imageUrl\": \"http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-ce9a/\" +\n\t      \"k2-_71a2c162-b553-428e-8e52-d149efbf0da9.v1.jpg\",\n\t    \"categoryId\": \"3944_3951_132960\",\n\t    \"assetId\": \"d1229ec0-d357-11e4-8c7c-258c79afbf66\",\n\t    \"uid\": \"IE78xV1I\"\n\t  }\n\t]} />\n\t```\n\t*/\n\t\n\tvar ModuleDrawer = function (_Component) {\n\t  (0, _inherits3.default)(ModuleDrawer, _Component);\n\t\n\t  function ModuleDrawer(props) {\n\t    (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, ModuleDrawer);\n\t\n\t    var _this = (0, _possibleConstructorReturn3.default)(this, _Component.call(this, props));\n\t\n\t    _this.state = {\n\t      baseHeight: 0\n\t    };\n\t\n\t    _this._normalizeRowHeight = _this._normalizeRowHeight.bind(_this);\n\t    _this._debouncedNormalizeRowHeight = (0, _debounce2.default)(_this._normalizeRowHeight, _this.props.resizeThreshold);\n\t\n\t    _this._calculateBaseHeight = _this._calculateBaseHeight.bind(_this);\n\t    _this._renderTiles = _this._renderTiles.bind(_this);\n\t    return _this;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  ModuleDrawer.prototype._getNodeFromRef = function _getNodeFromRef(ref) {\n\t    return (0, _reactDom.findDOMNode)(ref);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  ModuleDrawer.prototype._normalizeRowHeight = function _normalizeRowHeight() {\n\t    var revealer = this._getNodeFromRef(this.refs.Revealer);\n\t    if (!revealer) {\n\t      return;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var collapsable = revealer.children[0];\n\t    var grid = (0, _reactDom.findDOMNode)(this.refs.Grid);\n\t    var aTile = grid.children[0];\n\t\n\t    if (collapsable && grid && aTile) {\n\t      this.setState({\n\t        baseHeight: this._calculateBaseHeight({\n\t          rows: this.props.rows,\n\t          collapsable: collapsable,\n\t          grid: grid,\n\t          aTile: aTile\n\t        })\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  ModuleDrawer.prototype._calculateBaseHeight = function _calculateBaseHeight(opts) {\n\t    // Revealer has ability to auto-hide the toggle button when the\n\t    // content is less than the baseHeight.
